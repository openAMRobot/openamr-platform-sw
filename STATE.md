# STATE

Read this file before any work in this repository and update it in the same PR as the work.
The PR evidence check fails when STATE.md exists and a PR neither updates it nor says
"no change" with a reason. Keep it under 60 lines; facts only, each with a date or SHA.

## Repository

- Type and lifecycle: software, active
- Readiness: not yet assessed (17 Oct 2026, rollout step a)
- Owner role: software-lead (maintainers.yaml)
- Verification: CI workflows `nav-status-tests`, `drivers-bringup-tests` and
  `repository-quality`; no `tools/verify.sh` yet. `repository-quality` PASS on main at
  dfd44a5 (16 Oct 2026).

## Decisions this repository implements

FRAMES-REP105, NEAR-FIELD-FRAMES, NAV-LIDAR, CAMERAS, IMU-TOPIC-OWNERSHIP, DRIVE-TRACK,
DOCK-NO-CONTACTS, DOCKING-NOT-CHARGING.

## Known gaps

- Harness not pinned; `repository-quality` calls the reusable workflow at `@main` (step b).
- No `tools/verify.sh`; `quality/test` is skipped on main.
- Watchdog report-only on dfd44a5 plus this PR (17 Oct 2026): 46 decisions findings, 15
  public-extract price findings, 3 unpinned actions; fixed or tracked in step (c).

## Not verified

- Real-robot motion, docking and sensor bring-up; simulation and fake hardware only, since dfd44a5.
